<h1>Take back your content</h1>
<p>
  This is just an example site. But it could still be useful to show how you could import your content into a site that host yourself. Most blogs these days still run on a platform that has a database and a server and all that gubbins. But in reality, most could be hosted on as a pre-rendered site. Perhaps slurping in content from different feeds or content infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
  This site is generated by static site generator called <a href="https://11ty.io">Eleventy</a> and serves the content that it finds at a given RSS feed URL.
</p>

<h3>Give it a try</h3>
<p>
  You can get your own version of this site by just clicking the button below, and then providing a suitable Medium RSS feed URL.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository={{ pkg.repository.url }}">
    <img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" title="Deploy to Netlify">
  </a>
</p>
<h3>What will clicking that button do?</h3>
<p>
  Fair question. After clicking the button, <a href="https://www.netlify.com">Netlify</a> will ask for your permission to clone the <a href="{{ pkg.repository.url }}">repo for this site</a> into your own GitHub account, and then create a new site for you in Netlify linked to that repo. It will also ask for a feed to ingest at build time (see below if for some to pinch if you need to).
</p>
<p>
  Then it will build and deploy a new site for you, complete with hosting and continuous deployment all configured.
</p>
<p>
  The whole thing should take less than a minute!
